# CO2.Storage Schemas

[CO2.Storage](https://co2.storage) is the first Web3 data storage solution to enable comparisons of environmental data underlying tokenized carbon offsets. 

The [initial idea](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0006-FGTP-CO2_Storage.md) stemmed from the realization that the budding Refi space, and tokenized carbon credits in particular, would benefit from the development of standard data schemas for environmental assets.

The purpose of this repository is to publicly discuss and crowd-source data schemas for CO2.Storage. We are doing this to encourage standardization and reduce fragmentation of data schemas across the Refi space. 

Please refer to the [Instructions](https://github.com/protocol/co2_storage_schemas/blob/main/Schemas/Instructions.md) for details on how to submit a new schema to this repository.
